Welcome to SCOOPS's documentation!
=========================================

This software contains tools to analyze binding site dynamics and allostery.
It can find the volume of a pocket in an MD trajectory, suggest atom-atom distances
as order parameters, and correlate an order parameter with dihedral motion.  Source code
can be found `here <https://github.com/DanielJamesEvans/scoops>`_.
To see how to use the code, read the Jupyter notebook in the ``example`` directory included with the source code.
