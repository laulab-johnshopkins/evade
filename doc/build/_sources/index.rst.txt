=========================================

This software analyzes binding site dynamics and allostery.
It can find the volume of a pocket in an MD trajectory, identify residues at the pocket surface, and study how dihedrals influence
each other across the protein. Source code
can be found `here <https://github.com/laulab-johnshopkins/EVADE>`_.
To see how to use the code, check the ``example`` directory included with the source code.
