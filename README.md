# SCOOPS
SCOOPS analyzes binding site dynamics and allostery. It can find the volume of a pocket in an MD trajectory, suggest atom-atom distances as order parameters, and correlate an order parameter with dihedral motion.

To see how to use SCOOPS, please read the Jupyter notebook in the `example` directory.
